                    <p>June 2021: The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) issues a standing Order
                       for manufacturers to report certain crashes of vehicles which had automated driving systems. 
                       or Level 2 advance driver assistance systems. NHSTA was interested in possible safety concerns for
                       vehicles equipped with automated systems and in order for NHTSA to respond quickly to any safety defects.
                       NHTSA main concern was to immediately remove vehicles from the roadway which had any safety issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       April 2023: Latest Updates to the general order were posted for manufacturers as NHTSA continues to evaluate
                       Automated Systems in vehicles. According to the Essurance Study, 77% of Drivers in the United States have been in 
                       at least one car accident in their lives and that number is rising. 
                       In 2022, road crashes resulted in 38,000 people losing their lives each year and is the leading cause of death 
                       in the country.  These factors as well are taken into consideration while review ADS safety.

                    <p>The first remote-piloted cars were debuted by General Motors at the 1939 Worlds Fair. 
                        This eventually led to the first autonomous (self-driving) car prototypes in the 1980s 
                        after 30 years of testing.  Automated driving systems are still being developed and improved.
                        Currently in it's mature state, the aim is to perform the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained
                        basis without driver involvement.  These vehicles are being tested on public roads in limited capacities and 
                        currently not available for consumer purchase.  Some systems, level 2 advanced driver systems are available. These systems do require driver engagement.

            <div class="text-left">
                <p>The data collected is for crashes where automated data systems were in use and active within
                    thirty seconds of the crash.  For any level 2 ADS systems data must be reported if the system was in 
                    use within 30 seconds of the crash and te crash resulted in a fatality, tow-away, air-bag deployment 
                    and/or any individual transport for medical care.

                <p>
                    LIMITATIONS:  Crash data varies by manufacturers and the types of automation systems.  While data 
                    is very detailed and can be reported quickly as these systems are very advanced, the data is not 
                    standardized across manufacturers. Remote transmission capabilities vary also by manufacturer.  
                    Data reporting is also difficult as these vehicles are privately owned and reporting is based upon
                    owner reporting.  Reporting is completed when the manufacturer is notified not at the time of the crash.
                    Reporting is mandatory upon notification.  Initial reporting data may be incomplete as reporting at times
                    occurs prior to data verification.  Updated verification data is manddatory reported and therefore, does
                    improve data collection.  PII data is respected and therefore limits what is reported.  The same crash can
                    have multiple reports as there are multiple entities covered under mandatory reporting.  Therefore, the number of
                    reports does not equal the number of accidents or incidents.
